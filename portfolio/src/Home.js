     <p>My name is Gabriel Sharpton and I am a 24 year old junior software developer. Currently I am a student in the General Assembly Software Engineer Immersive Program. So far I have loved finding new ways to program and have found the challenge to be really fulfilling. I am very excited to build my portfolio with new languages and libraries. In the next 2 weeks I will have Python and Django experience under my belt.</p>
