# Portfolio-site

## This is my personal portfolio site that is constantly changing!

This site is to be used to hold all of my major projects I have been apart of. Everything linked is 100% done by me with minimal help to showcase my personal skills, unless otherwise stated. It currently has basic HTML and CSS but am currently working to implement some React >:).

I am very open to any suggestions you have or critisim for my projects, I firmly believe that it is the best way to learn is from listening to critisim from people more experienced. So dont hesitate to let me know what i've done well and what I could work on!
